## Discussion

### General

This application demonstrates the use of the fundamental web languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create an application that runs inside a web browser.

The demonstration takes the form of an arithmetic calculator.

The application fulfills a variation on the requirements of the “Mac Calculator Clone” exercise of the “JavaScript in the Browser” module in Phase 2 of the [Learners Guild][lg] curriculum. The exercise requires cloning the functionality of the Macintosh OS X operating system’s “Calculator” application, but this application modifies that functionality. The intent is to make a calculator with superior functionality and a more intuitive interface.

The exercise builds the application in 2 stages.

Stage 1 constructs a clone of the appearance and aesthetic response of the Calculator application of the Macintosh OS X operating system. The calculator responds to hovering and to clicks by darkening the target elements. Its appearance and response are produced by HTML and CSS code. The calculator does not calculate.

Stage 2 adds JavaScript code to make the calculator perform calculating operations in response to user actions. Stage 2 also changes the layout of the calculator and the set of its buttons. It also changes the appearance of the buttons, making them dim and inert when the state of the calculator makes them ineligible for use.

There is a [more detailed discussion](http://stulta.com/forumo/archives/2089) of this variation and its motivation.

### Implementation

As required by the terms of the exercise, all JavaScript in this application is intended to conform to the ECMAScript 5 standard, omitting any features that were introduced in ECMAScript 2015. The intent is to make the application compatible with browsers that have not been updated to support ECMAScript 2015, as well as those that have been.

## Usage and Examples

Stage 1: To experience the product of stage 1, open the [stage-1 web page](https://jrpool.github.io/calculator/stage1/) in a web browser, hover over buttons, and click on buttons.

Stage 2: To experience the product of stage 2, open the [stage-2 web page](https://jrpool.github.io/calculator/stage2/) in a web browser, hover over buttons, and click on buttons.
