## Discussion

### General

This application demonstrates the use of the fundamental web languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create an application that runs inside a web browser.

The demonstration takes the form of an arithmetic calculator.

The application fulfills the requirements of the “Mac Calculator Clone” exercise of the “JavaScript in the Browser” module in Phase 2 of the [Learners Guild][lg] curriculum.

The exercise builds the application in 3 stages.

Stage 1 constructs a clone of the appearance and aesthetic response of the Calculator application of the Macintosh OS X operating system. The calculator responds to hovering and to clicks by darkening the target elements. Its appearance and response are produced by HTML and CSS code.

### Implementation notes
